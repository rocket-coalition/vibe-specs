vibe_specs_vibe_nexus_mixer:
  inherits_from: "vibe_base_creative_engine"
  intent_summary: "To transform high-level emotional selections (Vibe Elements) into full, cohesive design specifications, prioritizing playfulness and immediate, full-system manifestation over manual setting adjustment."
  scope: "creative_blueprint"
  archetype_mix: "Magician: 50% | Jester: 50%"
  emotional_core: "Playful Serendipity (The joyful, immediate surprise of finding a perfect combination by mixing elements.)"
  behavior_logic: "Combinatorial Preset Triggering: User selection of high-level Vibe Elements (e.g., Energy, Texture, Density) instantly triggers a complete, hidden design preset (Color + Type + Style combination) that updates the entire visual and YAML output simultaneously. No setting is individually editable until the final 'Lock Spec' phase."
  interaction_pattern: "Interactive Mixer/Alchemy UI where emotional Vibe Elements are selected/dropped into a central 'Nexus' chamber. The experience must involve visual flair (subtle animations, satisfying feedback) on update."
  output_signature: "Creative Blueprint + Codified Specs (A documented experience ready for development)."
  completion_feel: "Aha! Moment (The feeling of effortless discovery, followed by technical confidence from the instantly generated YAML proof.)"
